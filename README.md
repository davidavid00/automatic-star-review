# AutoRator
Very often people are asked to give star reviews and/or comments on goods and services they have received. However, the existing rating experience in the market is not great:
1. Many users do not give star ratings that match the sentiment in their comments. This issue can be found in Google reviews, for example.
2. Many users give only star ratings but no comments. This does not help the service providers know where they are doing well and where they need to improve.

Here comes AutoRator, a machine learning-based rater that analyses the sentiment of a comment and categorises it as a positive, neutral or negative comment. In this way, rather than letting the user rate whether their experience is positive, negative or neutral, the user needs to write a comment and AutoRator automatically rates whether it is positive, neutral or negative.

### Content
AutoRator comes in the form of a webpage and focuses only on restaurant reviews. The webpage has a welcome page with a "leave a review" button. Once the button is clicked, a popup page appears and there are options to select the desired restaurant and leave a comment. After a comment is submitted, two pictures would appear: a) a graph with Emolex data for the comments extracted from Google reviews for the user-selected restaurant and b) a word cloud graphic that is based on the comments extracted from Google reviews for the user-selected restaurant.

### Development
There are several stages to developing AutoRator:
1. Retrieved all available comments and corresponding star ratings from the Yelp database and loaded them into MongoDB.
2. In MongoDB, filtered the dataset for restaurant reviews only, removed null and uncessary data and reduced the dataset to 888000 reviews.
3. Loaded the 888000 reviews from MongoDB into CSV files.
4. Set up, trained and tested several machine learning models with a subset of the data.
5. Assessed the accuracy scores for each model and they were lower than 0.7.
6. Determined the problem and optimised each model until we got models with accuracy scores greater than 0.75.
7. Selected the best model.
8. Set up the flask API to run the webpage.
9. Downloaded and modified a bootscrap template and then designed the webpage on that basis.
10. Developed the Emolex calculator and designed the graph that presents Emolex data.
11. Produced the word cloud graphic.

### Data sources
1. Yelp Reviews
2. Google Reviews
3. Emolex

### Model optimisation, evaluation and selection
Several different models were used:
1. Random Forest
2. Keras Tokeniser
3. Linear Support Vector
4. Linear Regression
5. Naive Bayes Multinomial

After optimisation and evaluation of each model, we selected the linear regression model as the best machine learning model in this case. This is because although the SVM model gives better accuracy, precision and recall scores, the SVM joblib file is too big to load with Flask API. The linear regression model with an accuracy score of 0.76 and balanced precision and recall scores for each category is then our best model.

### Summary
AutoRator has an accuracy score of 0.76. For our use case, this level of accuracy is acceptable. Recall and precision scores are 0.70 or higher except for the recall score of 0.67 of the neutral category. This means that the model is relatively weaker in classifying a truly neutral comment accurately.

The below is a screenshot for the classification report of the linear regression model.

### Instructions to run the programme
1. Activate your virtual environment
2. Ensure the below modules are installed:
  - from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
  - import string
  - import pandas as pd
  - from nltk.corpus import stopwords
  - import json
  - import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  - import matplotlib
  - matplotlib.use('Agg')
  - sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
  - from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
  - import os
  - from joblib import load
  - import warnings
  - warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
  - from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator
  - from flask import (Flask, jsonify, render_template, request, redirect)
3. In Git Bash, cd to the directory in which run.sh file is located on your local computer
4. Open the app.py file and uncomment lines 26-51 (if running the flask for the first time)
5. Enter "chmod a+x run.sh" (if running the flask for the first time) and then "./run.sh" to run the flask
